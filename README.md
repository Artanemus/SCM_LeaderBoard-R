### USING LeaderBoard

After install, by default, an icon is placed on the desktop. If you elected to disable this, type **lead** in the windows search bar to discover it. Else navigate to the **Artanemus** folder on the start bar. (All SCM applications and utilities are located in this folder.)

### ON START-UP

The application will ask you to login to the database. Currently there is no help file for this application. So I offer you these notes.

Got to the hamburger menu and select your preferences. Next, select one of the speed-buttons located top left. A leader-board will be produced. (Member, house, event, etc). 

The leader-board can be printed or exported out as PDF. 

> Use Windows **Apps and Features** to remove the application.
